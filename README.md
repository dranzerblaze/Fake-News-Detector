For vectorizing words & sentences, GloVe pre-trained vectors were used.

Batch Size :- 300

Epochs : 1

Accuracy achieved :- 72.12 % in LSTM Network and 75.74 % in GRU Network.


Result :- The GRU Network performs better than the LSTM Network significantly in just 1 Epoch. If we increase the number of epochs, we can see drastic changes in both accuracies.
